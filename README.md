### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The labs were incredibly helpful in setting up databases. Especially lab 4, where the connection between the frontend and backend happens I found that the instruction were incredibly heplful. I thought that the instructions for setting up on render with a full stack were confusing, and have had a lot of trouble setting that up as a result. I felt the largest issue for me was the differences betwee hosting on your local server and on the render.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have certainly added more style (currently the website is relatively barren since I focused on core features). I would make sure that the website was working properly on render, and I would also fix the delayde  response bugs that I get where a form submission does not update the display even though useEffects are used.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I wish I had no bugs in my final product, but that is what happens when it is your first time mixing front end and back end. I think I would build my backend first next time and work my front end around that and not the other way around. In this way I think I could avoid a lot of the bug that I got when I tried to shove back end into spaces that was designed for front end code.
